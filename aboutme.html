            <h4>The Basics</h4>
            <p>Hi!  My name is Kimber Highfill, and I'm a front-end web developer based near Macon, Georgia.  I'm 23 and a mom to a three-year-old, as well as a recent graduate from Central Georgia Technical College, where I received my Associate's in web design and development.  I'm a fast learner, and am always looking for opportunities to learn something new.</p>
            <h4>Why Web Dev?</h4>
            <p>It all started with a web design class I took my senior year of high school.  Until then, I had been unsure of what career I wanted.  XHTML brought a new interest into my life that satisfied my love of challenges as well as provided a creative outlet.  When I started college, XHTML had turned into HTML5 and CSS3, which provided a mostly-new environment for me.  As I learned about JavaScript, SQL, and PHP, I realized that web development is just the kind of puzzle I love.</p>
            <h4>My Goals</h4>
            <p>I know that the world of web development is always changing, and that I will always be learning.  I hope to one day be the kind of person that coworkers go to when they need help with their code, whether it be a missing end bracket or a JS function that won't work.  I also love teaching and would like to be able to mentor junior developers and teach them the tricks they'll need in the field, as well.  It's a far-off dream, but my dream nonetheless.</p>
